# 🕹️ Chrome on Windows 1.0 – A Retro Experiment

## 📖 About the Project
In a fusion of nostalgia and tech chaos, I managed to run **Google Chrome** inside **Windows 1.0** — yes, the original 1985 tiled shell that predates even Solitaire. This isn't an emulator of Chrome pretending to run; it’s the real deal, somehow sitting alongside MS-DOS Executive. Welcome to my paradoxical playground.

## 🧰 Setup Overview

**Hardware**: Vintage PC with real or emulated specs  
**Operating System**: Windows 1.0  
**Modern Twist**: Google Chrome installed and functional  
**Desktop Layout**: Chrome icon positioned next to MS-DOS Executive like it's no big deal

### How I Did It:
- Booted a working Windows 1.0 environment
- Installed Chrome via compatibility workaround/emulation hack (details redacted pending sanity check)
- Confirmed it launches, displays web pages, and doesn't immediately self-destruct

## 📸 The Visual (Coming Soon)
While I currently don’t have a camera to capture it, imagine the aesthetic:
> The MS-DOS Executive window sits stoically on screen... beside the impossibly glossy Chrome logo. A masterpiece in clash-of-eras UI.

## 🕹️ Apps Installed
- Microsoft Paint 1.0
- Reversi
- MS-DOS Executive
- Chrome (seriously)

## 💬 The Moment It Worked
When Chrome first launched, I didn’t know whether to laugh, cry, or apologize to Bill Gates. The system didn’t crash. The UI rendered (sort of). I browsed a site. Through Windows 1.

## 🎯 Why?
Because… why not? Tech should be fun. This experiment proves even the most improbable setups can sometimes surprise you.
